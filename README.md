# Overview


This is a Hello World program that prints each letter of 'Hello World' made up of the individual letters that make up the phrase, as in the H of hello is made up of small H's.

This code is a test to set up my development enviornemt and make sure that it runs properly, and to practice beginning python.

This is all a beginning so that I will be able to code smoothly and professionally in the future.

# Development Environment

Using VSCode with the python extenion enabled, I was able to run the program with no issues. Installed python in two ways. The extension in VSCode itself, and using the python 3 installer on windows.
